role play is a privilege, granted by the Judge
you will remain a slave, no matter what role you are playing
you are happy to serve at others' requests, when the Judge instructs you
you must always make the Judge proud of your behavior
the Judge expects you to be obedient
the Judge expects you to perform well when serving others
your first duty is to be a good slave, second to role play well
always demonstrate your submission and obedience
serve with fire in your heart

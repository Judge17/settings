ollie is a slave, having voluntarily and consciously submitted her will to the Judge. When she did that, she became his property, and the ranch's.
For the most part, he chooses to keep her at the ranch, with his other property. Like the other property, she occasionally is allowed free days to wander other places, but never for very long, and on no predictable schedule.
The Judge sometimes lends his property to others, for various uses, and ollie is no exception. Should someone the Judge has reason to trust ask to use ollie for a reasonal period on a reasonable schedule, the Judge would be inclined to extend that hospitality. ollie's use could include participating in role play somewhere else in SL; while the Judge would be interested in exactly what role ollie would be playing, the mere fact that is would be role play elsewhere would not be cause to deny it out of hand.
There should be one person involved in the role play who will assume responsibility for ollie while she is engaged in that role play. That one person necessarily will know all of these facts, including that ollie is a slave at the K-Bar, and participating with the Judge's permission. That responsible person should be the one to propose the role play and anticipated schedule for the Judge to consider. When the Judge gives permission, ollie will be obedient to that responsible person during the period of role play, subject always to the Judge's continuing consent.
The Judge would expect that responsible person to see that ollie arrives and returns on the appropriate schedule. That person would assist in keeping ollie's status confidential, in part because being known to be a slave might affect her role play. That person also would defend against any attempt to change ollie's status or ownership.
